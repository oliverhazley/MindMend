  "info.title": "MindMend Overview",
  "info.intro": "MindMend is designed to support mental wellness and PTSD management by leveraging Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data and evidence-based techniques. Compatible with devices such as Oura Ring, Polar H10, and other HRV-enabled sensors, it offers actionable insights, guided exercises, and interactive tools like Tetris therapy.",

  "info.hrvQuestion": "What is HRV?",
  "info.hrvAnswer": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures the variation in time between heartbeats. It's an important indicator of autonomic nervous system health, reflecting stress resilience and emotional regulation.",

  "info.ptsdQuestion": "PTSD and HRV",
  "info.ptsdAnswer": "PTSD can significantly impact HRV. Individuals with PTSD often show lower HRV, indicating chronic stress and reduced ability to adapt to emotional challenges. Monitoring HRV can help track recovery and stress management.",

  "info.howAppHelpsQuestion": "How This App Helps",
  "info.howAppHelpsAnswer": "Our app provides real-time HRV tracking, personalized interventions like mindfulness exercises, and data insights. By monitoring HRV patterns, users can better understand their stress responses and develop coping strategies.",

  "info.tetrisQuestion": "Tetris, really?",
  "info.tetrisAnswer": "Research shows Tetris can interrupt traumatic memory formation. Cognitive interference prevents vivid memory consolidation, helping reduce intrusive memories and PTSD symptom intensity. It's a non-invasive, engaging mental health intervention.",

  "info.exportQuestion": "How do I export data?",
  "info.exportAnswer": "Click the “Export Data to PDF” button on your Dashboard or Settings page. Download your report and share it with your therapist for deeper insights.",
